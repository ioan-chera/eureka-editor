## Earlier Work

André Majorel created the [Yadex](http://www.teaser.fr/~amajorel/yadex/) editor. Eureka began as a fork of this editor, version 1.7.0 to be precise.

Raphael Quinet and Brendon Wyber created DEU 5.21, which Yadex was derived from.

Both Yadex and DEU had many contributors, a comprehensive list of them can be found in the Yadex documentation.
