-  entering a negative "Length" in Linedef panel moves the start
   vertex of the line instead of the end vertex

-  use F1..F10 function keys for various menu shortcuts

Bugs Fixed:

+  fixed problem of unable to split lines close to an end-point

-  fixed problem of deleting a loop of linedefs inside another
   sector could sometimes delete that outer sector too

-  fixed unwanted rail texture when splitting a sector and the
   texture name began with '_' or '#' (such as "_WALL").

-  fixed rendering of unpegged lowers under sky ceilings
-  fixed textures in Linedef panel not updating after undo or redo
