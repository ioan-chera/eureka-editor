CHANGES IN Eureka 1.07 (r????)
==============================

(Changes since 1.00 version, r1416)


+  implemented Find and Replace (as a panel), with support for stepping
   though each item or selecting them all, and filters to control which
   items to visit or ignore

+  added 'File / New Project' command as the proper way to create a
   brand new WAD file.  The 'New Map' command requires a current pwad,
   and will save the fresh map immediately into it

+  new 'RECENT' category for Texture/Flat/Thing browsers,
   and rebound the '\' key to toggle this category on/off

+  new 'Rename Map' and 'Delete Map' commands in FILE menu

+  improvement to key binding system, support for "flags" which are
   parameters beginning with a forward slash, such as "/new" and "/clear".
   The 'EditKey' dialog is now much easier to use too

+  Windows package no longer uses an installer

+  vertex reshaping commands:
   -  'I' moves selected vertices onto a line
   -  'O' moves them into a circle shape
   -  'D' moves them into a half-circle
   -  'C' moves them into a 120-degree arc
   -  'Q' moves them into a 240-degree arc


-  a preference to show smaller textures in the browser

-  map checker can find unknown linedef and sector types

-  Linedef panel: swapped the 'Tag' and 'Length' positions

-  Linedef panel: always show a two-sided line panel when multiple
   lines are selected (allowing all texture parts to be edited)

-  Linedef panel: don't show rail/upper tex for one-sided lines
   (can be disabled with the 'show_full_one_sided' config var)

-  when loading a wad specified on the command line, and it contains
   settings for the iwad, port and/or resources, then allow command
   line arguments to override those values (and _add_ new resources)

-  new preference to maximize window on start (Linux, WIN32 only)

-  the Default Properties now has its own panel

-  Default Props: only a single wall texture now, and shows a sprite
   for the default thing which opens the browser when clicked on

-  added back the '192' grid size


-  browser: changed two key-bindings: 'T' now opens to Things and 'X' is
   used to open it to Textures (matching the menu shortcuts)

-  browser: changed key-binding for BR_CycleCategory to '|'

-  browser: the 'Sort' menu has been replaced with an 'Alpha' checkbox

-  browser: made sprites a bit smaller, can now show three columns when
   the browser is at minimum width

-  better way to show how a linedef will be split (esp. when snapping)

-  co-op player starts are now colored as in DOOM

-  3D view: the low/high detail flag is now a preference setting
   (no longer toggleable with the F5 key)

-  added info bar for 3D view, shows current position, angle, etc...

-  added 'Toggle 3D View' command to View menu


-  support loading a read-only wad file

-  support data in a map header lump (such as MAP01), make sure to
   save it when saving the map (instead of removing it)

-  node builder: added work-around for "TOO SIMPLE" levels
   (i.e. a single convex sector), creating a dummy node and an
   extra subsector and seg for the back side

-  wrote a Unix man page 

-  vanilla DOOM: do not show "friend", "coop" or "sp" thing flags

-  support -warp option being followed by two numeric arguments
   (episode and map number), compatible with vanilla DOOM

-  when checking textures, ignore ones beginning with '#'

-  show version _in_ the About box (not just the window title)


Bug Fixes:

-  fixed not loading 'ASHWALL' texture for DOOM 1

-  fixed bug when saving and using the 'ExMx' buttons
   (an erroneous newline was added into the map's lump name)

-  3D view: fixed a vertical mis-alignment of textures (one pixel)
   in certain circumstances

-  fixed occasional false positives with sector mismatch test

-  fixed wrong focal point when zooming immediately after the 'j'
   (JumpToObject) command

-  fixed category of linetype #68 (should be a raising floor)

-  fixed clipping of mid-masked textures (e.g. the cage in E1M9)

-  fixed not reloading textures (etc) when opening a new wad file

-  fixed crash when trying to build nodes on an IWAD map which has
   some changes made to it, but has not been saved (exported) yet

-  fixed key binding list so that pressing 'Bind', 'Copy' etc on a
   non-visible line will scroll to that line (make it visible)

-  browser: fixed patterns like '4$' not working properly
