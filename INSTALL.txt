INSTALLING (Linux)
==================

See the online documentation on how to build and install for Linux:
https://eureka.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#gnu-linux



COMPILING (macOS)
=================

Use CMake. You can download and install CMake from their website, or use a
third-party package manager such as Homebrew. Easiest to use is the graphical
interface version of CMake (CMake GUI).

Unlike on Linux, on Mac it's strongly advised to let CMake fetch FLTK from
GitHub; do not set USE_SYSTEM_FLTK to ON. This is needed because of some late
bug fixes on macOS FLTK.

The generated Xcode project or Makefile will ultimately produce an "Eureka Doom
Editor" graphical application. If you generated a Makefile, there's no "make
install" stage. Simply open the produced app.



DISTRIBUTING (macOS)
====================

To distribute a signed app of Eureka, you need to generate an Xcode project
first -- signing and notarizing the app is currently not supported from the
Makefile. You can also distribute the app generated by Makefile as-is, but users
will be warned that the app isn't signed, and prompted to move it to Trash
(unless they access the app from the right-click menu in Finder).



COMPILING (Windows)
===================

Use CMake, same as on macOS. Similarly, the FLTK project shall be downloaded and
built by CMake itself.



SETTING UP Eureka
=================

Eureka requires an IWAD file from one of the supported games, for
example "doom2.wad".  Eureka will look for IWADs when it starts up,
but if it cannot find any then the 'Manage Wads' dialog will open
and you can browse for an IWAD file there, which will be remembered
for next time.

Places where Eureka looks for IWADs:

  1. The "iwads" directory in Eureka's home directory.  In Linux
     this will be "~/.config/eureka/iwads" (or "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/eureka/iwads").
     It is created automatically the first time Eureka is run (though there
     is no harm in creating it yourself).

  2. (a) In Linux: /usr/share/games/doom
     (b) In Windows: C:\DOOM and C:\DOOM2

  3. If you run Eureka from the command line and have the DOOMWADDIR
     or DOOMWADPATH environment variables set, then Eureka should find
     it the specified directory.

  4. If running from the command line, Eureka will look in the current
     directory for the IWAD.

  5. You can specify the IWAD file directly with the --iwad option.
