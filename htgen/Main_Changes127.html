<br  />+ support mixing textures and flats for ports that allow it
<br  />+ improved 3D mode, can move things and sector surfaces
<br  />+ ratio lock, makes producing lines at certain angles easier
</p>
<p class='vspace'>- a single status bar for both 2D and 3D views
<br  />- new popup menus to set edit mode, browser mode, scaling
<br  />- render sectors in the 2D view with both lighting and texturing
<br  />- create void islands by drawing lines anti-clockwise in a sector

<br  />- added scale "-" and "+" buttons, show scale as percentage
<br  />- ability to highlight/select railings in 3D view
