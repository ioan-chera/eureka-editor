<p class='vspace'>I'm excited to announce that Eureka is now available for Windows!
You can find an installer on the download page.
The installer is very bare-bones at the moment, since I'm still climbing that learning curve, but it will add Eureka as a program to the Start menu.
So far it has been tested on Windows XP and Windows Vista, it should work on Windows 7 too, but I don't know whether Windows 95 or 98 are going to work (reports welcome, as always).
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Other improvements include:
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><ul><li> Preferences dialog
</li><li> Key binding system, with GUI in preferences
</li><li> Automatically back-up edited wads (multiple times)
</li><li> Status area on info bar -- replaces map name

</li><li> Log viewer

<p class='vspace'>Eureka 0.88c is a small update to the 0.88 release,

</li><li> fixed the slime trails in the 3D view
</li><li> fixed bug in 'Manage Wads' dialog resetting the port to 'boom'
</li><li> fixed a compile problem on 64-bit machines
</li></ul><p class='vspace'>I have also made a Debian package for i386 architecture (32-bit machines).
This is designed for the Debian 6.0 "Squeeze" distribution, but
hopefully will work on other OSes too (Ubuntu, Arch, Mint, etc...).
This is the first time I have made a debian package, and I welcome reports on
whether or not it worked OK on your system.
