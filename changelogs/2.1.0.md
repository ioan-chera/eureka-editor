# CHANGES IN Eureka 2.1.0

(Since version 2.0.2)

## Editing features

* The thing spawn flags are now defined in UGH files.
* Corrected some advanced source port thing flag definitions.

## User interface

* Now on macOS key bindings preferences, show 'CTRL' instead of 'META' for the control key.
* Corrected high DPI display to actually use the full resolution in the map view.
* Fixed the wrong user manual link from the Help menu.
* Thing spawn flags (options) can now be changed directly by the number, not just by check boxes.

## Bug fixes

* Further fixed the multiple dragging bug as it wasn't properly fixed before.

## Organizing

* Now on Linux the user settings and cache are stored XDG compliant (in `~/.config/eureka` and
  `~/.cache/eureka`), instead of haphazardly in `~/.eureka`. Existing settings from the old folder
  will be transferred to the new places.

## Backend

* Updated FLTK to version 1.4.3. Fixes include:
  - crash in macOS when switching full screen Eureka between displays, particularly if one of them
    has scaled pixels
  - locking up in macOS when reading an invalid JPEG file
* Fixed some Debian building and segfault problems -- thanks to jordibc for the fix!

## Documentation

* Added contributors to AUTHORS.md

## Development

* FLTK is now loaded using CMake `FetchContent` instead of being built in a raw fashion using a
  custom command.
* Added CMake options to use system FLTK and/or Google Test, as opposed to fetching them from
  GitHub. This will help fix issues for systems where internet access is blocked.
