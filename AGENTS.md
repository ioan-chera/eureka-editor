When editing or adding code, use literal tab characters for indentation, not groups of eight spaces. The entire codebase is styled with tab characters for indentation.

When building for testing compilation, use the Makefile generator. The environment is preferably Ubuntu or any such Linux.

The project uses FLTK. You would need a way to automate FLTK UI testing if that has to be done without visual input/output.
