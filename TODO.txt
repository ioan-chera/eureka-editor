Eureka TODO / WISHLIST
======================

See also github.com/ioan-chera/eureka-editor list of issues.


Slightly Possible
-----------------

+  support resources in PK3 files

-  linedef mode: '[' and ']' to adjust length of current line

-  Tools/Make Door
-  Tools/Make Lift

-  a way to clear the Browser recent lists

-  a dialog to restore a map from a backup

-  can import DWD (DoomEd) format maps

-  allow Game/Port definitions to specify the linedef/thing flags
   which can be used  (rather than hard-coding them)

-  when dragging a shape next to existing geometry, highlight
   vertices and linedefs which would get merged, and implement
   that merging

-  Preferences window:
   -  backup_max_files / backup_max_space
   -  floor_bump_xxx values

-  ability to autosave to a hidden file, and if Eureka crashes or
   power fails, can detect it and allow user to restore from it

-  treat sprite UI_Pic in THING panel and DEFAULTS panel as a
   highlightable thing, and possible Copy/Paste target

-  Resource Dialog : when add a ".wad", check for same file with ".ugh"
   extension and automatically add it too when it exists

-  View/Place Camera command, cursor turns into '+'
   [ need an ACT_ASK_SPOT action, plus a /ask flag for command ]

-  Operation menu:
        for "ACT_XXX" commands, turn pointer into a '+' and
        wait for user to begin action (with MOUSE1..3 or SPACE key)

-  replace "Toggle XXX" in View menu with checkboxes

-  texture checks : warn about a 2S switch line with same switch in
   both the UPPER and LOWER textures

-  sector splitting: when choosing which side (left or right) will
   become NEW sector, prefer the loop which DOES NOT include any
   self-referencing linedefs

-  in Find/Replace panel, can filter things by CATEGORY

-  PRINT key makes a screenshot of 2D or 3D view

-  a sector rendering mode that shows floors which are same texture
   as the currently hilighted one.  [ also for ceilings ]

-  for the "Edit -> Paste" menu, turn the cursor into crosshairs
   and wait until the user selects a spot to paste to

   OR: show the objects as the mouse move arounds, similar to
       dragging stuff but less intense

-  a key to copy properties TO defaults (e.g. 'y' for yank)

-  feature "tile_nonpow2"  [ emulate tutti frutti when absent ]

-  draw the sky texture in 3D view

-  when browser opened by a click, jump to the texture/etc clicked on

-  MMB on sidedef/sector tex : open RECENT browser

-  BOOM colormaps in 3D view



Rejected Ideas
--------------

NO:  a toolbar

NO:  a scripting language

NO:  Restore last window position and maximized state

NO:  un-hard-code menu shortcuts?

NO:  ability to use an external node builder

NO:  if a given pwad (from command line) does not exist, ask to create it

     perhaps: --create or --new option?

NO:  built-in cheat sheet for mouse buttons and common keys

NO:  document the config file syntax


NO:  when one vertex of a linedef is moved (and not the other)
     update the X offset on the appropriate side (right side for start,
     left side for end vertex)

NO:  support SPACE/INSERT in linedef mode (and line is highlighted or selected)
     split the line and put vertex where mouse is
     [ can do this in vertex mode easily enough ]

NO:  a proper "curve" tool for making a circle arc or bezier curve,
     and new vertices would be constrained to that curve, and you can
     move existing vertices onto the curve

NO:  merge vertex and linedef modes

NO:  nicer way to select map, render a small 2D version of each map
     and present them in a scrolling list

NO:  ability to drag the camera (on 2D viewport)

NO:  when moving a sector and the camera is inside it, move camera too

NO:  ability to edit Lua code for OBLIGE prefabs


NO:  3D view: handle very tall/thin window, letter box with black

NO:  an auto-save feature (e.g. save every N minutes unless no
     changes occurred in the last N minutes)

NO:  a name-only mode for texture and flat browsers

NO:  exchange object numbers

NO:  check that current pwad has been externally modified

NO:  when highlighting a sector, draw the things in the same color
     but diimer, to show sector operators will affect things too

NO:  support Chex Quest 1 and 2

NO:  ability to "remove line 271" (etc) in port definitions


NO:  "USED" category for the browser

NO:  speed up grid drawing when step is small and zoomed out

NO:  integrate Visplane Explorer

NO:  support DDF / LDF / EDF as (or in) a resource file

NO:  "fix" missing coop starts, place them near player #1

NO:  a key to toggle "grab mouse" mode in 3D view

NO:  animation mode, render continuously and show any lighting
     effects and animated / scrolling textures and sprites

NO:  ability to hide the right-side panel

NO:  disconnect sectors : automatically include islands

NO:  quantization should prevent linedefs from overlapping / crossing

NO:  for quantizing a group of objects, try about 9 delta positions
     (x+0, x+step/4, x-step/4 etc...) and choose "best" quantization


NO:  autocomplete flat/texture names in Linedef and Sector panels

NO:  when building REJECT, support a simple distance check
     [ i.e. if distance between two sectors >= N, mark as cannot see ]

NO:  make read errors in BSP code more tolerant (DON'T call FatalError)

NO:  edit-key dialog has a button which opens a web browser to
     the documentation about the current command

NO:  a mode to show skill levels via color of drawn things
     [ draw sprites in 2D/3D view differently too ]

NO:  when get "Area not closed" error, show the place where it fails

NO:  Browser search box: allow ',' for OR
     --> split match into N pieces, perform normal match on each

NO:  a command to split-line-in-half-and-move-to-curve

NO:  able to drag stuff around in 3D view, raise/lower floors

NO:  large font mode, more readable on 1920x1080 monitors


NO:  support DECORATE as (or in) a resource file

NO:  support Windows 95/98/ME
     [running on Windows 98SE requires KernelEx]

NO:  conversion between Hexen <--> DOOM formats
     [ perhaps as a script ]

NO:  conversion from Boom --> vanilla DOOM

NO:  for DOOM have "Switch", "Grating", "Door" categories

NO:  add MBF things: 2016 "BETA Sceptre", 2017 "BETA Bible"
