CHANGES IN Eureka 0.74 (r1421)
==============================

(Main changes since 0.72 version)


+  show the current WAD and map in the window title bar.

+  clipboard persists when changing maps, so you can copy-n-paste
   from one map/wad to another map/wad.

+  various user state (grid settings, camera, editing mode, etc..)
   persists when a map is saved, and is restored when the same map
   is loaded again.

+  improved SECTOR insertion:
   (a) copy properties from a selected sector, or try a neighboring
       sector if no selection.  Use default value as last resort.
   (b) if CTRL is pressed, then new area BECOMES the same sector as
       the one selected.

+  new 'Sort' setting in Thing/Line/Sector type browsers.

+  new 'ADD' and 'DEL' sidedef buttons in the LineDef panel.

+  new -port option to select the source port.  Defaults to boom.
   Other values currently supported are: vanilla, edge.

-  fixed problem where you could seemingly close a line loop, but due to
   grid snapping the vertex was merely placed on top of the existing one
   and it did not actually close the loop.

-  fixed bug where closing a line-loop around an existing shape did
   not apply the new sector to the outside of that shape.

-  new outside-of-map sectors now occupy a single grid square.

-  File/New does not ask for map slot unless there's a current PWAD,
   since that will be asked on the File/Save (== File/Export).

-  File/Export asks for the map slot _after_ the filename.

-  dynamic rotating (CTRL + middle button) no longer scales.

-  dragging/scaling/rotating vertices will draw the lines too.

-  fixed display of a certain flat (CEIL4_1 IIRC) which was showing
   bright cyan in parts that should be black (palette color #247).

-  better looking About box.
